Cyber Home Lab: Beginner Pentesting Journey 🔐💻
Welcome! This repository documents the setup and progress of a personal cyber security home lab. The goal is to gain hands-on experience in ethical hacking, vulnerability analysis, and security research using popular tools and platforms.

Lab Overview 🧰
This project uses multiple environments and tools to build foundational cybersecurity skills:

Operating Systems: Kali Linux (Attacker) 🐉, Metasploitable2 (Vulnerable target) 🎯, and Windows (Victim/target) 🪟

Core Tools: Nmap 🕵️‍♂️, Wireshark 🐠, Nessus 📊, Metasploit ⚔️, and more

Learning Resources: OWASP Top 10 📚, security testing guides, and web vulnerability platforms

Getting Started 🚀
Lab Setup 🛠️
Kali Linux: Deployed as the main attacker VM.

Metasploitable2: Used for safe practice in exploiting vulnerabilities.

Windows (VM): Acts as a typical target for vulnerability assessment.

All systems are configured on a local network using VirtualBox. Samples of custom network configurations and VM screenshots are found in this repo.

Tools & Techniques Explored 🔎
Nmap 🕵️‍♀️
Scans networks for open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities.

Example commands and findings are included.

Wireshark 📡
Performs packet capture/analysis of traffic between lab machines.

Sample pcap files and analysis notes provided.

Nessus 📈
Automated vulnerability scanner, used to generate reports on various VM targets.

Reports and summary explanations included for each scan session.

Metasploit 🗡️
Exploits vulnerabilities in Metasploitable/Windows environments.

Step-by-step walkthroughs available for common attack scenarios.

Learning OWASP 📖
This lab uses resources from OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) to understand real-world web vulnerabilities:

OWASP Top 10: A list of the most critical web app security risks—each lab exercise maps back to one or more Top 10 items.

Hands-On Testing: Using vulnerable apps and guides to test SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass, etc.

Progress & Experience 🌱
This repository serves as a live portfolio—each commit represents progress through learning modules, tool usage, or security challenge completion. All sample reports, walkthroughs, and screenshots are original unless otherwise noted.

What you'll find:

Step-by-step lab setups

Scan results with explanations

Vulnerability report summaries

Write-ups of attack methods and mitigation steps

Future Goals 🎯
Expand to additional platforms (e.g., Parrot OS, new Windows targets)

Explore automated web app security testing with OWASP ZAP

Contribute learning notes and resources back to cyber security communities
